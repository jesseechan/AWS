# ETL Pipeline Project

In this project, I will be creating an ETL Pipeline Project with taxi information provided by the NYC government. I am using S3, Glue, and Redshift to develop the data pipeline.

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an object storage service offered by Amazon AWS.

Amazon Glue is a service used to transform, prepare, and clean data. It is used for data analytics, machine learning, and application development.

Amazon Redshift offers fast, simple, cost-effective data warehousing. You can use the powerful SQL analytic capabilities to generate insight across the data.
