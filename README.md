# ETL Pipeline Project

In this project, I will be creating an ETL Pipeline Project with taxi information provided by the NYC government. I am using S3, Glue, and Redshift to develop the data pipeline.

[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) (Simple Storage Service) is a highly scalable object storage service offered by Amazon AWS. 

[Amazon Glue](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/) is an ETL service used to transform, prepare, and clean data. It is used for data analytics, machine learning, and application development.

[Amazon Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/) offers fast, simple, cost-effective data warehousing. You can use the powerful SQL analytic capabilities to generate insights across the data.
